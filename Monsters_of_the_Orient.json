Each court is presided over by a {@b court king of Diyu}; a celestial entity of great power. Each king commands the very court itself as well as numerous umbral and void serpents. When a court king decides that a creature has suffered enough for its crimes, he sends it back to King Quinguang where it might be judged again for other crimes committed.",

Based on what the mirror reveals, King Quinguang sentences a creature to one of the other courts."

King Chujiang presides here, giving offenders a punishment reflective of their crimes. His punishments include perpetual burning in a fiery pit, being frozen to the core, or perpetual drowning in a pool of blood.",
									"{@b Nirarbuda, The Third Court.} Those sent here are guilty of ungratefulness, disrespecting their elders, or raiding tombs. King Songdi's punishment always includes cutting a creature's heart out, but the particularly vicious wrongdoers are also tied to a glowing hot copper pillar.",
									"{@b Atata, The Fourth Court.} If a creature is guilty economic fraud or cheating, it is sent to Atata. King Wuguan judges those sent here to either be bound and continuously pounded by a large stone mallet or be restrained within a large mortar while a massive pestle grinds them.",
									"{@b Hahava, The Fifth Court.} This court is for those that have plotted another's death to obtain their property and for money lenders that charged exorbitant rates. King Yanluo lets transgressors tumble down a never-ending slope of the sharpest blades.",
									"{@b Huhuva, The Sixth Court.} Cheaters and kidnappers are sent here, along with those that objectify others, or waste food. A visit to The Sixth Court entails being slowly sawn into two from groin to head by King Piencheng, only to be glued back together before starting over.",
									"{@b Utpala, The Seventh Court.} Those who have committed psychological abuse or thrived on sowing rumors about others. King Taishan pulls out the tongues of his visitors before trapping them in a wok of boiling oil.",
									"{@b Padma, The Eighth Court.} The Eighth Court is the destination for those that have brought dishonor or shame to their family. King Dushi pulls out their intestines and dismembers their bodies.",
									"{@b Avici, The Ninth Court.} Only the worst of the worst are sent to Avici. Rapists, murderers, and those that had the means to stop such atrocities but didn't are among those found here. While those sentenced to another court are always released at some point, most of the souls trapped here are never released. The court is presided over by King Pingdeng. Each prisoner is dismembered and crushed for all eternity.",
									"{@b Men-Po Pavilion, The Tenth Court.} Those that find themselves in The Tenth Court have either lived a decent life or been thoroughly punished for their crimes. King Zhuanlun presides over this domain but doesn't actually pass any judgment. Instead he offers each newcomer a cup of magical tea the Tea of Forgetfulness. It permanently clears a consciousness of all past memories, and even a wish spell can only restore fractions of those memories. Only Orochi herself can ever truly return all memories that have been lost in this way. A visitor must drink the tea before being capable of entering Youdu. Men-Po Pavilion is full of visitors who refuse to drink the tea for various reasons."

They eat grasses, herbs, leaves, bark, and twigs. They stockpile huge amounts of food in a giant pile, which they will need when food is scarce in winter.

A yak measures from 3 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs up to 1,800 pounds with males being larger than females. Yaks have a massive, low-slung body, a huge hump on their shoulders, and hoofed feet. Yaks have very long fur, and during the winter, they also grow a short, thick fur undercoat which insulates them from the cold. They are herbivores that graze on grasses, but also browse on the leaves of low-lying shrubs and herbs."
